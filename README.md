# Interactive Loddlenaut Webmap

A simple interactive webmap for the game [Loddlenaut](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1644940/Loddlenaut/), including toggleable markers in many categories. This is the code repo for the map, you can find the actual map here:

This map was built with the Javascript mapping library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), along with the plugins [leaflet.fullscreen](https://github.com/brunob/leaflet.fullscreen) and [Leaflet.Control.Layers.Tree](https://github.com/jjimenezshaw/Leaflet.Control.Layers.Tree). The tiles for the map were created using screenshots from the game (with a lot of help from a custom mod) and cut/resized/arranged using a Python script.
